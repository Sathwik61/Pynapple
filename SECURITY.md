## Title: Security Risk: Exposed MongoDB Credentials in .env file

Description:

Hi Sathwik,

I noticed that the MongoDB credentials are exposed in the .env file in this public repository. This is a serious security risk, as anyone can access the credentials and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.

To address this issue, I recommend removing the credentials from the .env file and using environment variables to store sensitive data

Please remove the exposed credentials from the .env file as soon as possible to prevent any potential security breaches.

If you need help or guidance on how to address this issue, feel free to ask.

Best, Ganesh
